The Story of June 2023, before I completed my engineering degree, I had more than 5 to 6 job offers in my hand. For context, I've already shared [my freelancing journey](https://blog.soumyamondal.com/my-freelancing-journey-since-2016), and this will continue that story. I'll explain how I landed a job and **why I chose an in-office position** despite having remote offers.

From the beginning of my third year of engineering, I started gaining a lot of exposure from my blog posts and a bit from my YouTube channel as well. While I was looking for internships at that time, a few small startups offered me full-time roles.

# Interview Experiences

I interviewed with many companies over 1 to 2 months. Some expected me to have DSA knowledge, others wanted product knowledge, and some were looking for specific development skills.

Most interviews focused on the MERN stack since I specialized in it and shared content about it. For reference, I've created a [GitHub repo of all the interview questions](https://github.com/lifeofsoumya/MERN-Interview-Questions) I faced at that time.

Although I cleared most of the interviews, some of them changed my perspective and positively impacted how I approach interviews.

Living in Kolkata, the salary was not very attractive. I received a few remote roles as well but I couldn't stop thinking about the experience I would miss if I worked from an office.

I finally decided to let go of the remote offers, especially in the early years of my career. Why so?

## Advantages of In-Office

Working in an office has provided numerous benefits to my experience:

* Meeting new people and building professional relationships.
    
* Gaining skills and knowledge that might not be accessible in a remote setting.
    
* Experiencing the dynamics of a grouped environment.
    
* Stepping out of my comfort zone and adapting to a new city
    

The initial 3-4 months were hectic as I adjusted to the new city and work environment.

# My thoughts

I believe choosing an in-office role was the right decision. The experiences and skills Iâ€™ve been gaining besides tech, will be invaluable for my career growth.
